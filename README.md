Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.

![Explanation](http://www.rightscale.com/blog/sites/default/files/docker-containers-vms.png)

It is quicker than a VM and much more customizable.

We use Docker for the *dev environment*.

To install :

    git clone this project
    ./install/linux-install.sh if you're on Linux
    ./install/osx-install.sh if you're on iOS
